# Reddit Probability Bot

A bot built in Python that performs basic probability tasks, such as rolling dice or flipping coins. You can view the bot [here](https://www.reddit.com/user/ProbabilityBot_).

## Usage

You must first call the bot with `/u/ProbabilityBot_`, and then use one (or multiple) of the following commands. You can only have one command per line, and it must be at the beginning of the line.

### !roll

This command rolls one or more dice, and provides a breakdown of what you rolled. By default, it rolls a single 6-sided die. The maximum number of dice you can roll at once is 50 and the maximum number of sides a given die can have is 10000.

#### Arguments

You can specify how many and what kind of dice to using standard dice notation:

* `X`: rolls `X` 6-sided dice

* `dY`: rolls a single `Y`-sided die

* `XdY`: rolls `X` `Y`-sided dice

* `XdY+Z`: rolls `X` `Y`-sided dice and adds `Z` to the total

* `XdY-Z`: rolls `X` `Y`-sided dice and subtracts `Z` from the total

* `XdY*Z`: rolls `X` `Y`-sided dice and multiplies the total by `Z`

In addition, you can use these flags:

* `--nb`: no breakdown of your rolls is provided and the maximum number of dice you can roll at once is increased to 1000

* `--s`: sorts the breakdown of your rolls (descending)

* `--a`: calculates the average result of your rolls

* `--dl`: discards the lowest roll

* `--dl N`: discards the lowest `N` rolls

* `--dh`: discards the highest roll

* `--dh N`: discards the highest `N` rolls

### !fate

Rolls [Fate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fudge_(role-playing_game_system)#Fudge_dice) (or Fudge) dice. By default, it rolls 4 dice.

#### Arguments

You can specify how many kind of dice to using standard dice notation:

* `X`: rolls `X` Fate dice

* `+Y`: rolls 4 Fate dice and adds `Y` to the total

* `-Y`: rolls 4 Fate dice and subtracts `Y` from the total

* `*Y`: rolls 4 Fate dice and multiplies the total by `Y`

* `X+Y`: rolls `X` Fate dice and adds `Y` to the total

* `X-Y`: rolls `X` Fate dice and subtracts `Y` from the total

* `X*Y`: rolls `X` Fate dice and multiplies the total by `Y`

In addition, you can use these flags:

* `--nb`: no breakdown of your rolls is provided and the maximum number of dice you can roll at once is increased to 1000

### !flip 

Flips one or more coins. By default, it flips a single coin.

#### Arguments 

* `N`: flips `N` coins

### !pi

Approximates pi. The probability of two random numbers being coprime is 6/Ï€<sup>2</sup> ([source](http://www.cut-the-knot.org/m/Probability/TwoCoprime.shtml)). Therefore, if we generate N pairs of random numbers, count how many of them are coprime, and do a little math, we can approximate PI. By default, it uses 1000 pairs of random numbers. The maximum number of pairs you can do is 100000.

#### Arguments

* `N`: use `N` pairs of random numbers

You got tails.
You got 20 heads and 20 tails.
With 1000 iterations, I approximated PI as 3.194383.
With 4000 iterations, I approximated PI as 3.140759.
